<h1>What is HTML History?</h1>
<p class="lead">
    Use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history">HTML History API</a>
    allows you to make changes to the browser's location without initiating an explicit request back
    to the server.
</p>
<p>
    This is valuable because you can change the
    location through code and maintain explicit control over how
    your application behaves. For instance, you may choose to manually
    update the browsers location and then request partial page content
    via an Ajax request. The benefit to this approach is that as you
    keep the location updated, should a request be made to that specific
    location in your application, you have the opportunity to render a
    snapshot of the HTML that corresponds to the state of the application
    based on the given URL.
</p>
<p>
    If your user's <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=pushstate">browser is not capable of using the History API</a>, then
    you may consider using the <a href="/articles/what-is-hashbang">hash</a> to keep the URL updated.
    Ultimately the best approach is to use the History API where it is supported and
    feature a fallback implementation if it is not available in the browser.
