<h1>What is Hijax?</h1>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijax">Hijax</a> is the progressive enhancement concept of taking control of link clicks via JavaScript.</p>
<p>
    The links (anchors) include normal <code>href</code> values that work
    just as well for browsers that have JavaScript disabled as they do for
    search engine bots. When JavaScript is present (in a normal web browser) the
    click action on the link is intercepted or "hijacked" and an Ajax request is
    initiated rather than allow the standard full-browser request for the page.
