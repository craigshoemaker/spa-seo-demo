<h1>What is Hijax?</h1>
<p class="lead">
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijax">Hijax</a> is the progressive
    enhancement concept of intercepting link clicks via JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    The links (anchors) include normal <code>href</code> values that work
    just as well for browsers that have JavaScript disabled as they do for
    search engine bots. When JavaScript is present (in a normal web browser) the
    click action on the link is intercepted or "hijacked" and an Ajax request is
    initiated rather than allow the standard full-browser request for the page.
</p>
<p>
    The following code listing demonstrates how you can select all relative links
    in jQuery:
</p>
<pre>
var selector = '#content-container a[href^="/"], ' +
               '#content-container a[href^="' + window.location.origin + '"]';
            
$(selector).on('click', function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var href = this.getAttribute('href');
    // do some processing here
    return false;
});</pre>
<p>
    The Hijax approach is often used in conjunction with either the
    <a href="/articles/what-is-hashbang">hash/hash-bang</a>
    or <a href="/articles/what-is-history">history</a> implementations to keep the URL
    updated during Ajax requests. Read more on the <a href="/articles/overview">architectural overview</a>.</p>
