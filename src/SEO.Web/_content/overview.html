<h1>Architectural Overview</h1>
<p class="lead">
    The concept is simple. Use <a href="/articles/what-is-hijax">
    progressive enhancement techniques to allow the page to operate as a rich web application when JavaScript is
    available</a>, render real markup and keep the <a href="/articles/what-is-history">URL in sync with your content</a>.
</p>


<h2>Render Markup on First Request</h2>
<p>
    The first step is to render the markup to the page that is appropriate given
    the URL and it's parameters. This could be the full markup of the content
    that can or will be loaded into the page, or it could be a snapshot of the
    content. The key here is to have markup rendered in the page that is available
    for a search engine bot to consume.
</p>


<h2>Intercept Link Clicks/Taps</h2>
<p>
    Once the content is loaded on to the page, then you want to be able to take
    control of how content is loaded in the application. By <a href="/articles/what-is-hijax">
        taking control of the
        clicks
    </a> you can stop the page from navigating to the selected page and instead
    make an Ajax request to get the partial page in order to render in the browser.
</p>


<h2>Inject Partial Into Container</h2>
<p>
    Once you have the response of the Ajax request then you can inject the partial
    view into the container in your view. This makes the new content available to
    the user on the screen.
</p>


<h2>Update the URL</h2>
<p>
    Whether you are using the <a href="/articles/what-is-hashbang">hash</a> or <a href="/articles/what-is-history">history</a> strategy to keep the URL updated, you
    must make some sort of change to the URL.
</p>


<h2>Clean Up</h2>
<p>
    Once you have effectively "navigated" to a new page by getting the new markup and
    updating the URL, then you need to finalize the work by updating the page title
    and handling back and forward button actions to make sure the page is always in
    sync with the URL.
